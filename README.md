# ðŸ¥ž Tech Stack

_TypeScript, React, Redux, React Router, Formik, Tailwind CSS, Jest, React Testing Library_

I have chosen to use some open source libraries to help speed up development time and to limit myself to my understanding of the scope of the task, i.e. have nice tabbed form ui with validation which handles data. I don't want to get carried away on the intricacies of anyone task but offer a complete solution. 

* Scaffold the app with _[create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/#selecting-a-template)_ using the TypeScript template.

* For navigating tabs _[react router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)_

* Pulling some help from _[formik](https://formik.org/docs/guides/validation)_ for validation and _[tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)_ for styling.

* Testing approach will come in the form of integration style test using _react testing library_ and unit tests to cover the redux state.

* Hosting the code on _git hub_ and using _[AWS amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-react-app-amplify-graphql/module-one/?e=gs2020&p=build-a-react-app-intro)_ to host a version for your pleasure.
